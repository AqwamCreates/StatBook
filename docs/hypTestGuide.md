## Introduction

Hypothesis Testing is a critical procedure in statistics for validating an assumption regarding a data sample. It provides a framework for making statistical conclusions about populations based on sample data.

---

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the Null Hypothesis**
2. **State the Alternative Hypothesis**
3. **Determine the Level of Significance**
4. **Collect and Analyze Sample Data**
5. **Make a Decision**

---

## Null Hypothesis

The Null Hypothesis, denoted by \( H_0 \), is a statement of no effect or difference and serves as the basis for statistical testing. 

**Example**: \( H_0: \mu = 25 \)

---

## Alternative Hypothesis

The Alternative Hypothesis, denoted by \( H_a \), is what you aim to prove. It is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis.

**Example**: \( H_a: \mu \neq 25 \)

---

## Types of Tests

- **One-tailed test**: Looks for an effect in only one direction.
  - Right-tailed
  - Left-tailed
  
- **Two-tailed test**: Looks for an effect in either direction.

> ALL TESTS IN THIS MODULE ARE TWO-TAILED. A future update with one-tailed options may come in a a future update.

## Test Statistics

Depending on the sample size and known parameters, different test statistics like Z, T are used.

- **Z-test**: Known variance, large sample size
- **T-test**: Unknown variance, small sample size

---

## P-value

The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed results, or something more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.

- **Low p-value (\( < \alpha \))**: Reject the null hypothesis
- **High p-value (\( > \alpha \))**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis

---

## Decision Making

- **If \( p-value < \alpha \)**: Reject the null hypothesis
- **If \( p-value > \alpha \)**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis

---

## Conclusion

Hypothesis testing is a cornerstone method in statistics for verifying assumptions about a population based on sample data.
